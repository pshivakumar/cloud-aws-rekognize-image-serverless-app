## Introduction

The Rekognize Image Serverless App is a powerful and scalable serverless application built on AWS. It leverages AWS Rekognition, a deep learning-based image and video analysis service, to perform image recognition tasks. This application is designed to help you easily integrate image recognition capabilities into your own projects, apps, or workflows.

---

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Quickly and accurately recognize objects, people, text, scenes, and more in images.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilize AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and S3 for a highly scalable and cost-effective solution.
- **Event-Driven**: Automatically process images in real-time as they are uploaded to an S3 bucket.
- **Customizable**: Modify and extend the application to meet your specific image recognition needs.
